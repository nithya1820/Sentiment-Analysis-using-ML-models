# Enhancing Sentiment Analysis in Code-Mixed Malayalam Text: A Machine Learning Approach.
This repository consists of summaries and insights of Sentiment Analysis articles, mainly the problems and findings based on the literature review. Explore this repository to expand your knowledge in this area and also get a hold of some materials and tutorials for you to get into the same.
This literature review was done as part of a pre-internship program and as a group of three, we read 14 articles each on this area and made up our literature review. This repository is a part of a phase for our program. It will include blog-like posts on the findings and issues stumbled upon by the researchers in the read articles and how they have approached them.

The Sentiment Analysis using LLM has step-by-step processes involved that make it to the study and analyses of the study
- Understand Sentiment Analysis:
  Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text—whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
- Data pre-processing:
  To perform sentiment analysis, you'll need a dataset with text samples labelled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)and preprocess and format this data for training and evaluation.
- Fine-tuning and feature extraction:
  The dataset set must be adapted to perform a specific task on a pre-trained model.
- Analysing Precision and accuracy
- Analysing the research gap/limitations of the study you did
- Studying future enhancements compared

### About:
The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This beginner-friendly program will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

This 3-course Specialization is an updated version of Andrew’s pioneering Machine Learning course, rated 4.9 out of 5 and taken by over 4.8 million learners since it launched in 2012. 

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

# About blog
## Introduction
In our study we mainly focus on the problems addressed below:
-	This research paper addresses the pressing problem of developing effective and robust methods for sentiment analysis in Dravidian languages. 
-	This challenge is becoming worse because of the unique characteristics of these languages, including morphology and script diversity. 
-	We focus on the unique linguistic and cultural characteristics of these languages and the complexity of multimodal data. This is to improve content moderation and user experience within these linguistic communities.

We went through several articles and found some common as well as different issues.
Through my blogs, we will be analysing each paper I have reviewed and providing insights on the topic with referrals and tutorials wherever necessary.
