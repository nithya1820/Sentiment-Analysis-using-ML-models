# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LLM-s
This repository consists of summaries and insights of Sentiment Analysis articles, mainly the problems and findings based on the literature review. Explore this repository to expand your knowledge in this area and also get a hold of some materials and tutorials for you to get into the same.
This literature review was done as part of a pre-internship program and as a group of three, we read 14 articles each on this area and made up our literature review. This repository is a part of a phase for our program. It will include blog-like posts on the findings and issues stumbled upon by the researchers in the read articles and how they have approached them.

The Sentiment Analysis using LLM has step-by-step processes involved that make it to the study and analyses of the study
- Understand Sentiment Analysis:
  Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text—whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
- Data pre-processing:
  To perform sentiment analysis, you'll need a dataset with text samples labelled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)and preprocess and format this data for training and evaluation.
- Fine-tuning and feature extraction:
  The dataset set must be adapted to perform a specific task on a pre-trained model.
- Analysing Precision and accuracy
- Analysing the research gap/limitations of the study you did
- Studying future enhancements compared

# About blog
## Introduction
In our study we mainly focus on the problems addressed below:
-	This research paper addresses the pressing problem of developing effective and robust methods for sentiment analysis in Dravidian languages. 
-	This challenge is becoming worse because of the unique characteristics of these languages, including morphology and script diversity. 
-	We focus on the unique linguistic and cultural characteristics of these languages and the complexity of multimodal data. This is to improve content moderation and user experience within these linguistic communities.

We went through several articles and found some common as well as different issues.
Through my blogs, we will be analysing each paper I have reviewed and providing insights on the topic with referrals and tutorials wherever necessary.
